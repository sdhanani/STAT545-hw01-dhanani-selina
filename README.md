# Welcome to Selina's STAT 545 page!

## About me
I am an Unclassified student furthering my knowledge in both Biology and Statistics here at UBC. I am currently taking [STAT 545](stat545.com) and [BIOL 300](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/bio300/).  

I began my schooling at Simon Fraser University and completed my degree in Biology and minor in French in 2014. Since then I have spent 2 separate field seasons discovering the Nevada backcountry chasing after birds. Between seasons, I worked at a startup company to bring sustainable aquaponics to Vancouver. 

When not studying or on adventures in the field, I enjoy bouldering, yoga, mountain biking and [(muggle) quidditch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG3fmTdnvHg).

## About this repo
This is my repo for ~~all my STAT 545 files~~ my first STAT 545 homework assignment, familiarizing myself with *the* **syntax** of R Markdown, getting used to RStudio, Git and GitHub.

I have done some **preliminary** exploration of the gapminder dataset that can be found [here](https://github.com/sdhanani/STAT545-hw01-dhanani-selina/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md)

## The process
1. I created the appropriately named repo on GitHub
2. Launched RStudio and opened a new project and chose version control and did the following:
    + copied and pasted the URL from my new GitHub repo into the URL box
    + gave the project a name
    + determined a directory to which to save my work
3. Modified the README.md file. I found this [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) particularly helpful to figure out the different types of formatting available and inserting links etc...
4. Saved the README.md file 
5. Created a commit with all the files that had been changed
6. Pulled from my repo on GitHub (developing good practice habits)
7. Pushed the files to my repo on GitHub

## Struggles 
The biggest struggle I had was figuring out the specific syntax required for R Markdown. Having never taken a formal coding class or coded in anything other than R, having to be very specific about where the spaces are and how many there are was a new experience but the cheat sheet helped me out quite a bit with that. Once I got the hang of the syntax, I enjoyed using R Markdown and am looking foward to becoming more familiar with this tool.
