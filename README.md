## About me
I am an Unclassified student furthering my knowledge in both Biology and Statistics here at UBC and I am currently taking [STAT 545](stat545.com) and [BIOL 300](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/bio300/).  I began my schooling at Simon Fraser University and completed my degree in Biology and minor in French in 2014. Since then I have spent 2 separate field seasons discovering the Nevada backcountry chasing after birds and worked at a startup company to bring sustainable aquaculture to Vancouver.
